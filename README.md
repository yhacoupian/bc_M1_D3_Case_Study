> Who are their competitors?

JP Morgan Chase is the largest US bank but has other competitors including Bank of America, Margan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citi, and Wells Fargo.

The Treasury Department recently issued a letter allowing these large banks to connect to blockchains as validator nodes allowing them to transact stablecoin payments on behalf of customers.

> Why are they considered a FinTech company?

JPM Coin is primarily a tool to help instantly transfer funds between some of JPMorgan's clients. Such a digital currency is needed for an exchange of money to take place between parties on a blockchain ledger.

JPM Coin is the tool that helps to complete that process more efficiently than traditional settlements.
